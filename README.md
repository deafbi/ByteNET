<h6>Also please contribuite to this project to help it out</h6>

In this repository I have made it is to show a simple javascript botnet that I made and to 
help raise awareness to penetration testing and cyber attacks

I created a Flask login system that utilizes sessions to authenticate users and stores 
hashed passwords for security purposes. This system was then integrated into ByteNET

Here is info on th bots and a attack system, map system, and if you click on one you get the result 
page.

Then you can click one of the bots to bring you to the result page which is to view cookies or local storage after attacks sent
including screen captures or location.

If you direct back to the dashboard their is also a payload section for payloads to copy and paste into
a vulnerable input or use in a js injection.
